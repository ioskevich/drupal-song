When Drupal 8 Came Marching In
When Drupal 8 Came Marching In
When Drupal 8 Came Marching In
Oh what a relief, to finally see that number 
When Drupal 8 Came Marching In
But Drupal 7 is still in style 
And it will stay here for awhile
Oh I don't mind to be in that number
Cuz Drupal 7 is still in style
When Drupal 6 reached end-of-life
There were a few folks feeling strife
But others said good riddance to that number
When Drupal 6 reached end-of-life
Now everyone can sing and shout
Cuz Drupal 8 is finally out
So everybody let's sing Hallelujah!
Cuz Drupal 8 is finally out
Well Drupal 9 can take its time
Cuz Drupal 8 is perfectly fine
Oh I don't wanna even think about that number
Drupal 9 can take its sweet time
So clap your hands, and raise a cheer
Cuz Drupal 8 is really here
Yes we all want to be in that number
Cuz Drupal 8 is really here.
